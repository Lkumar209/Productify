My friend ,Sid Kalje , and I made a Productivity Application for Task Managing and time management to maximize efficiency when accomplishing a series of tasks. This application was built in Python(both Front-end and Back-end) with the following libraries: Tkinter, TtkBootstrap Requests, Time, Plyer and the Courier Send API for the notification system of this application. In Productivity there is a pomodoro timer for the user to manage their time while working, and a task list for work to accomplish. There is also a quote generator that pops-up different quotes everytime, along with a textbox that asks for your number and email to send you those quotes to keep you motivated! With the Pomodoro timer, once the timer ends or a break starts, the Application automatically sends you a notification to your phone number to keep you updated, this is done through the Send API from Courier. There is also a seperate box in the application where you can customize reminders and have the application send any type of desktop reminder you want in any amount of allotted time. To make the UI aesthetically pleasing, we added a option for a light mode and dark mode with TtkBootstrap themes! This Project was submitted to multiple Hackathons and is a fun passion project my friend and I wanted to do!
